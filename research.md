#### __Internship at IISc Bangalore__

I am currently working as research intern in the project based on speech processing and machine learning offered by [SPIRE Lab](https://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/spire/) of IISc. In this project, I am getting hands on experience in speech processing, machine learning model implementation and python framework Django.

##### __Project Description:__

* Developing a web interface which will take particular kind of phonation from user and predict if any vocal disorder is present

* Python framework Django is used for web development

* First the audio input is taken from the user. The speech features essential for particular kind of prediction is extracted using python speech processing libraries praat-parselmouth and librosa.

* The machine learning models are developed and deployed for prediction. 

* When a user uploads his/her audio sample the web gives the prediction about the presence of disorder if any and generates a report in pdf format.

* __Pedestrian Detection and Direction Prediction using Video Processing__ [[code](https://github.com/A-Vaishnavi-1010/Pedestrian_Project)] [[ppt](https://github.com/A-Vaishnavi-1010/Pedestrian_Project)]
    
    The system used input video of pedestrian and three different approaches are implemented to detect the pedestrian and predict the direction of motion using video processing in MATLAB.

* __Counting number of coins in an image using Image Processing__ [[code](https://github.com/A-Vaishnavi-1010/Coins_Project)] [[Report](https://github.com/A-Vaishnavi-1010/Coins_Project)]

    Region segmentation is performed using different image processing techniques and hence identified coins and calculated the area of coin using MATLAB.

* __Bank Management System__ [[code](https://github.com/A-Vaishnavi-1010/Banking_System_Project)]
    
    Bank management system is implemented using Object Oriented Programming and file handling to create, modify, delete bank account and perform different tasks like money deposit, withdraw, balance check, etc.

* __Rotation of Solar Panels for Maximum Utilization of Sunlight__ [[code](https://github.com/A-Vaishnavi-1010/Solar_Panels_Project)] [[Report](https://github.com/A-Vaishnavi-1010/Solar_Panels_Project)]
    
    A system is implemented with a sensor, a microcontroller and an actuator. The direction of sunlight is observed and the solar panels are rotated accordingly for maximum utilization of available sunlight.
