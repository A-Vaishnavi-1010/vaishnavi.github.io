### <ins>__Research Projects__</ins>

I am currently working as research intern in the project based on speech processing and machine learning offered by SPIRE Lab of IISc. In this project, I am getting hands on experience in speech processing, machine learning model implementation and python framework Django.

##### __Project Description:__

* Developing a web interface which will take particular kind of phonation from user and predict if any vocal disorder is present

* Python framework Django is used for web development

* First the audio input is taken from the user. The speech features essential for particular kind of prediction is extracted using python speech processing libraries praat-parselmouth and librosa.

* The machine learning models are developed and deployed for prediction. 

* When a user uploads his/her audio sample the web gives the prediction about the presence of disorder if any and generates a report in pdf format. 


### <ins>__Academic Projects__</ins>

* __Pedestrian Detection and Direction Prediction Using Video Processing__
    
    The system used input video of pedestrian and three different approaches are implemented to detect the pedestrian and predict the direction of motion using video processing in MATLAB.

* __Counting number of coins in an image using Image Processing__  

    Region segmentation is performed using different image processing techniques and hence identified coins and calculated the area of coin using MATLAB.

* __Bank Management System__
    
    Bank management system is implemented using Object Oriented Programming and file handling to create, modify, delete bank account and perform different tasks like money deposit, withdraw, balance check, etc.

* __Rotation of Solar panels for maximum utilization of Sunlight__    
    
    A system is implemented with a sensor, a microcontroller and an actuator. The direction of sunlight is observed and the solar panels are rotated accordingly for maximum utilization of available sunlight.
